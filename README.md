# Speaking Robot

The **Speaking Robot** is a simple, interactive web project that demonstrates the use of JavaScriptâ€™s Web Speech API. The robot speaks aloud based on user input, starting with an automatic introduction and then prompting for the user's name. Afterward, the user can type a message that the robot will speak aloud.

## Project Purpose

This project is designed to demonstrate how text-to-speech capabilities can be implemented using basic web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The robot adds an element of fun by interacting with users and responding verbally. 

The goal is to showcase how the Web Speech API works in a simple yet interactive format, offering both a practical application of the technology and an entertaining user experience.

## Project Features

1. **Automated Robot Introduction**: As soon as the webpage loads, the robot will introduce itself with the message: "I am a text-to-voice speaking robot. Can you enter your name, please?"
   
2. **Personalized Greeting**: The robot will prompt users to enter their name. After the name is submitted, it will greet them, saying "Hello <name>, what would you like me to say?"

3. **Custom Speech Input**: The user is then prompted to input any message they'd like the robot to speak. The robot will speak aloud the entered message using the Web Speech API.

4. **Robot Animation**: While the robot speaks, its mouth moves to simulate the speech process, adding a visual dynamic to the interaction.
